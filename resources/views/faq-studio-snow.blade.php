            Our facility consists of four dance studios and one acting/dance studio and a voice studio. We have a professional faculty and floating wood floors for long-term body/joint protection.

            <strong>Viewing Windows and TV lobby monitor</strong><br>
            In order to foster each dancerâ€™s progress, please observe students through windows or lobby TV. Students, especially those new to dance, improve at a more accelerated pace without the scrutiny and pressure of parents, peers, and other observers peering throughout the window.  The dancers can see you thru the windows.

            <strong>Lost & Found</strong><br>
            Look in cubbies for left items. Those items, including dance shoes, not picked up will be donated to a local charity.

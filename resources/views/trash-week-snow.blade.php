            “Trash Week” is the first FULL week of each month when your child may wear any color leotard and tights to class. They may also wear ballet skirts, leggings, shorts, etc. during trash week.
            <br><br>
            Viewing windows will be open during “Trash Week” and will continue to be open all month as long as the “window” is not causing too much distraction for dancers. Standing at the outside windows and waving or tapping on our inside window distracts the entire class and disrupts the classroom setting.
            <br><br>
            Please save costumes for Halloween week, as these can be very distracting to their learning.

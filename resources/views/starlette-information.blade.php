            Please arrive at the studio early enough to put on dance shoes, and use the bathroom.
            <br><br>
            Arriving early is also great for some one-on-one time with your youngster. Although they are excited about dance class, it can be difficult to transition into the dance class settingâ€¦one-on-one time helps to alleviate some of this anxiety.
            <br><br>
            You do not have to remain in the lobby during your childs class time unless you feel more comfortable doing so. You are more than welcome to stay, in case they may need you to potty or for something else.
            <br><br>
            Any medical problems and allergies must be told to the front desk and the instructor.
            <br><br>
            We recommend giving your child 1 month to get acclimated. At that time, should there be the need, we will set up a meeting with you to reassess the best options for your child. We want what is best for all of our students!

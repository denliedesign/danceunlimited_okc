                                        Chelsea Jones is a graduate from Oklahoma University with a BFA in Musical Theatre. While performing was fun for Chelsea, she felt more fulfilled teaching. She has been teaching consistently with Dance Unlimited for almost 9 years now and enjoys all disciplines! Chelsea is the head of the dance department at Heritage Hall, and works consistently with the DU Starlette program at DU. Teaching is Chelsea’s passion but when she’s not teaching, she is being a mom to Jentry (6) and Janson (3) and eating as many sour patch kids as she can!

She recently graduated with a degree in Musical Theatre from the University of Oklahoma, and her favorite style of dance to teach is tap. Natalie’s goal for her students is to help them discover that the studio is a safe place to learn, grow, create, fail, and succeed. She wants her students to feel confident yet challenged, and remember that the work is always worth it. Natalie is thankful to be back with her Dance Unlimited family!--}}

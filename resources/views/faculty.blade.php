                                        Chelsea Jones is a graduate from Oklahoma University with a BFA in Musical Theatre. While performing was fun for Chelsea, she felt more fulfilled teaching. She has been teaching consistently with Dance Unlimited for almost 8 years now and enjoys all disciplines! Chelsea is the head of the dance department at Heritage Hall, and works consistently with the DU Starlette program.  Teaching is Chelsea’s passion but when she’s not teaching, she is being a mom to Jentry (5) and Janson (2) and eating as many sour patch kids as she can!

                -No skirts attached to leos or that tie on. These can become the full attention during class time and we like to only have skirts during
                <a href="#trash-week" class="red-txt">"Trash Week"</a>!
                <br>
                -Jewelry and watches must be removed before entering the dance class. These can become objects that may accidentally break or scratch another student, so we like to leave them outside the classroom.
                <br>
                -Dance bag should be packed with dance shoes, outside shoes, and Kleenex. No food or water.
                <br>
                -Names should be written inside of ALL dance shoes.
                <br>
                -Please remember that dance shoes are inside shoes…have special outside-shoes to wear to and from the dance studio. Concrete will ruin dance shoes!
                <br>
                -Hair is in a bun, with bangs secured out of face.
                <br>
                -Hair that is too short secure in 1 or 2 ponytails and clip stray hair out of face.

                        “Trash Week” is the first FULL week of each month when your child may wear any color leotard and tights to class. They may also wear ballet skirts, leggings, shorts, etc. during trash week.
                        <br><br>
                        Viewing windows will be open during “Trash Week” and will continue to be open all month as long as the “window” is not causing too much distraction for dancers. Standing at the outside windows and waving or tapping on our inside window distracts the entire class and disrupts the classroom setting.
                        <br><br>
                        Please save costumes for Halloween week, as these can be very distracting to their learning.
